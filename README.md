# Learn-ThreeJS 🚀

This repository is a personal learning journey into [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) — a powerful JavaScript 3D library that brings 3D graphics to the browser using WebGL.

## 📌 About This Repo

This project is meant to serve as:

- A **practice ground** for exploring Three.js concepts.
- A **reference base** for common patterns like setting up scenes, cameras, lighting, and controls.
- A **foundation** to build advanced interactive 3D simulations and visualizations in the future.

- ✅ Using OrbitControls for camera interaction  
- 🔄 Animating objects  
- 🔜 Loading textures and 3D models  
- 🔜 Particle systems and post-processing effects
